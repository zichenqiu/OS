Project 2a


In this project, I implement a command line interpreter (CLI) (commonly known as shell), called wish. It is basically an interactive loop: it repreatedly print a prompt wish>, parse the input, executes the command specified on that line of input, and waits fo the command to finish. This is repeated until the user types exit. 


In addition, there are four built-in command: exit, cd, history and path. Moreoever, There are two addidtional features: redirection and piping. 


This unix shell is tested against the "runtests" script that can be found in /u/c/s//u/c/s/cs537-1/tests/p2a. To invoke this shell, simply type make, and ./wish. You may begin to enter command after seeing "wish>".
