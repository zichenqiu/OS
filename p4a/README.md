Project 4a: Mapreduce

In 2004, engineers at Google introduced a new paragidm for large-scale parallel data processing known as MapReduce. One key aspect of MapReduce is that it makes programming such tasks on large-scale clusters easy for developers; instead of worrying about how to manage paralleism, handle machine crashes, and many other complexities common within clusters of machines, the developer can just focus on writing little bits of code and the infrastrcuture handles the rest.


In this project, we built a simplified version of MapReduce for just a single machine.
