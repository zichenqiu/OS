This assignment builds a set of linux utilities but much simpler versions of common used commands: my-cat, my-sed, my-uniq.

1. my-cat.c reads a file as specified by the user and prints its contents.

2. my-sed.c is a command line version of find and replace the exact given string. It will find the first instance of a string in a line and substititute with another. It will print the output to standdard output. Instances following the first instance remain as is. In case there is no candidate to substitute the line will be printed as is.

3. my-uniq.c is a version of the unix utility uniq which will detect adjacent duplicate lines from the input file and removes them and writes out to an output file.
