Project 5
File System Checking


In this assigment, we will be developing a woking file system checker. A checker reads in a file system image and makes sure that it is consistent. When it is not, the checker takes steps to repair the problems it sees. 



For this project, we will use the xv6 file system image as the basic image that you will be reading and checking. For more deatils about this project, click here: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shivaram/cs537-sp19/p5.html
